                            Once the POC is validated, we develop a working prototype to demonstrate the core features of the product. This includes refining designs, sourcing components, and assembling the product to a stage where it showcases its primary functionality. Prototyping allows for multiple rounds of testing and improvements, ensuring the product works as expected and meets the userâ€™s needs before moving into mass production. </p>
